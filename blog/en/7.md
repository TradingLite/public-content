At first, it may look like very little has changed, but we've pretty much rewritten the internals from the ground up.
This should allow us to implement more advanced functionality in the future while delivering better performance and reduced memory usage.

As with everything new, if you notice any old bugs resurfacing, please let us know on our discord.
