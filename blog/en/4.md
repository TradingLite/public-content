We're finally moving towards **Phase 7** which marks the end of invite-based signups.
Our user flow has been quite steady these recent few weeks, to a point that it matched our monthly invite quota.

Unfortunately, our waiting list has proved itself to be unreliable. Many people joined the queue but our invite emails would bounce off 70% of the time. Meaning that for every 10 people, only 3 would signup in the end. 

This wasn't the case at first, our success rate was 80% signups and only 20% never received their invite.
Somehow, this whole invite process got worse and worse over time.

Anyway, here's a pointless little graph to illustrate this:

*ONE MONTH AGO:*
<div style="display:flex;width:100%;min-height:2rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden;">
  <div style="text-align:center;width:80%;background:var(--primary);color:#F0F0F0;">80% INVITED</div>
  <div style="text-align:center;width:20%;background:var(--secondary);color:#F0F0F0;">20% ???</div>
</div>

*TODAY:*
<div style="display:flex;width:100%;min-height:2rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden;">
  <div style="text-align:center;width:30%;background:var(--primary);color:#F0F0F0;">30% INVITED</div>
  <div style="text-align:center;width:70%;background:var(--secondary);color:#F0F0F0;">70% WHERE DID THEY GO???</div>
</div>

As for the invite codes, they worked well but had very low numbers which forced our randomly-selected volunteers to remind people that those codes existed.
Not a great solution for them, nor us, nor those who are constantly on the lookout for invite codes like their life depended on it.

Here's another pointless graph to illustrate this:

<div style="display:flex;width:100%;min-height:2rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden;background:#DDD;">
  <div style="text-align:center;width:90%;background:var(--primary);color:#F0F0F0;">90% SIGNUP RATE</div>
</div>
<div style="display:flex;width:100%;min-height:2rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden;background:#DDD;">
  <div style="text-align:center;width:30%;background:var(--secondary);color:#F0F0F0;">10% EFFICIENCY</div>
</div>
<div style="display:flex;width:100%;min-height:2rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden;background:#DDD;">
  <div style="text-align:center;width:97%;background:var(--tertiary);color:#F0F0F0;">99% COOL FACTOR FOR HAVING YOUR OWN INVITE-CODE</div>
</div>

So what we're trying now is allowing for anyone to signup for a trial freely, without making our future users wait impatiently for us to click on that juicy "SEND INVITES BATCH" button.

It's now all about:
*INSTANT GRATIFICATION!*

## Brave New World

Allowing anyone to signup at any time, I wonder how this will go.
We won't make any big announcements about this at first, we'll just sit and watch.
If this proves to work well, we'll leave it as it is. If not, then we go back to the drawing board.

Making this change also means that we have to tighten up on our trial account limits.

## What's cooking?

#### Referral System

It's work-in-progress, rejoice!

#### Early Access & Early Access+ Trials

We're also working on giving our users the chance to try out our higher-tier plans for a reasonable amount of time. These plans would be related to our referral system that's currently being planned.

#### LitScript rewrite progress

Still in early phase, but the progress is going well. We're halfway there.
