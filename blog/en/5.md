Our current slider caps are defined manually and adjusted over time, but with this new feature you're no longer bound to our restrictions.
That's right folks, now you can adjust heatmap range however you want. *Freedom at last!*

This little new popup is the beginning of our advanced heatmap customization tools, more to come in the future.

## News + Update
