* Endnote

# Data

There is a lot to say on the technical side, let's keep it short and see how it affects you as a user. 

We have doubled the precision on all our data sources:
- This will **fix rounding issues** on the heatmap and get rid of anomalies such as a 1000 contract trade showing up as 999.

We send partial updates instead of full data snapshots:
- This will provide faster update rates while using **less bandwidth**.

### Realtime data

We set up a new cluster of servers that are used for realtime data. 

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/server-map.svg)

* 2x Germany - FSN
* 1x Finland - HEL

If you hover over the signals icon on the bottom of TradingLite, you can see to which server you're connected and your ping to that server.

At this moment servers are randomly assigned, but this is just the first step towards expanding to other regions like America and Asia.

### Orderbook data

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/orderbook-100ms.svg)
Orderbook data has had overall improvements, besides increased stability, we're now also compressing the data which allows us to provide the same data at a much higher rate. Every 100ms!

Also, by using some nifty tricks we also increased orderbook panel range for Bitfinex!

### More data for LitScript

We've added `funding_predicted` and `mark_price` to LitScript, for all exchanges where it's available.

# HD VPVR, VPSV and Footprints data



Another big change you'll quickly notice is how much finer some indicators have become. This is because we're collecting 5 times more data.

This mass of data allows us to make the long-awaited HD footprints.

Footprint layer has been completely rewritten, made more useful thanks to user feedback.

Since we have more data, VPVR might appear a bit too detailed. This is why we've also added the **Ticks Per Row** option. You can use this to re-create how these indicators used to look like before, or aggregate the data even further.

The good news? **This new HD data is included in all plans by default!**

# App

TradingLite's UI has once again been updated, bringing some of that elegant oomph.

Lets start with *flashy* features:


First we got a new "fake" white theme, also known as **"Inverted Color Mode"**. 
Previously this used to be a small secret feature, but due to popular demand we made it into an official one!

Note that this isn't an actual white theme, the colors are just inverted.

<small class="caption">Inverted Color mode</small>


We have also further optimized and improved the performance in various places. 
To help our users know what the hell is going on while things are loading, we've added **download progress indicators**.

<small class="caption">Download progress indicators</small>


**Focus Mode** has been improved with the ability to change exchange/pairs without exiting it.
We've also added a toggle button on the sidebar, this way more people are aware that this feature exists.

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/focus.jpg)
<small class="caption">Focus mode</small>

**Layouts feature** is another big change of this update. All your settings and drawings are now saved per layout, this way you can have multiple configurations of TradingLite.

<small class="caption">Layouts</small>

**Exchange menu** has been improved to include favorites and search functionality!

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/exchanges.jpg)
<small class="caption">New exchange/pair search</small>

Mobile users and those who use TradingLite in a small window, now have these useful **scroll buttons**. 

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/smallscreen.jpg)
<small class="caption">Arrow buttons to help with scrolling</small>

**Indicator labels** are now more useful than ever.
You can now click any of the labels and use those handy shortcuts for quick changes, if you don't like it then you can simply hide them in the layer options.

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/layerlabels.jpg)
<small class="caption">New labels!</small>

We moved to **UTC Time**, begone those issues with Daylight savings time!
In case your system clock is badly configured (more than 1min difference), we will notify you with a message.

### Changes to App URL

Shortcut to access an exchange pair directly has changed from 
```
tradinglite.com/chart/coinbase/BTC-USD/5
```
to
```
tradinglite.com/chart/XXXXXXX/coinbase/BTC-USD/5
```

where `XXXXXXX` is your layout ID (seen on the new urls after `/chart/`)

# Website

Website has been once again redesigned, but in order to keep this short we're only gonna dive into most noticeable changes.

### Help Center

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/helpcenter.jpg)

Accessible from inside the app and the website, as of right now it's fairly simple but we'll add more questions and answers as they come.

### LitScript Reference

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/refdocs.jpg)

Reference docs have been updated to show shapes and colors, small change but it's better than guessing inside LitScript what each shape looks like.

### Security

![](/public/images/thumbs/alpha/security.jpg)

A brand new section, where you can enable **2-Factor Authentication** and see all your **Connected Devices**.

We've also improved how you update your password and email, everything is now more streamlined!

# Endnote
