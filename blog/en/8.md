## Undo / Redo

It has finally arrived, you can now **undo/redo** to your heart's content!


## Complete redesign of Script Vault 

That old _"Scripts Window"_ with its awful UI has haunted us since day one. 
Maybe you haven't noticed it, but your unconscious mind definitely did. 
Much like an ad-infested site that you visit daily, you develop a blind spot. Your tormented mind, actively adjusting itself to block bad design decisions. 
The only time when you realize the truth is when things change... and this change will finally open your eyes.

## Favorites

Finally, some structure to this slowly accumulating chaos, you can now **favorite** scripts!

As for indicator developers, we'll be working on fancy analytics page in the future.
