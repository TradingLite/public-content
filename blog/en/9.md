## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `K` on your keyboard and it shall appear!

This is still early in dev, but we'll improve it in the future. Stay tuned!

## Focus mode

Ever looked at our interface and said _"Man, this minimalistic design seems way too bloated, and that prevents me from achieving true enlightenment._
_If only there was a way to get rid of all non-essential elements so that TradingLite can open up my 7th chakra and connect me to Divinity."_ ?

Yeah, I know the feeling. So this is why we're now introducing our **Focus mode**. This is feature also commonly known as **Distraction Free Mode**, the idea is simple: get rid of all visible buttons and leave the bare minimum. 

Try it out by pressing `F` key on your keyboard on our platform. 

You can then also press `Shift`+`F` to go fullscreen for full immersion.

Focus Mode will only become more useful as we further improve TL's keyboard friendliness.


## Fixed blurry font

We did it! 

The blocky smudged font should no longer haunt some of our users. 

Please let us know if this solved your font issue.
