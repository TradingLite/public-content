First of all, we're glad that our Alpha update went more-or-less smoothly, there were some unexpected bugs here and there but hopefully they've all been solved.

### Updates delivery

We decided to do updates a little bit differently this time. We'll push updates regularly, and we'll make these kind of news posts later along with some of our bigger changes. This allows us to quickly patch things up without polluting our blog with smaller update posts.

If you want to know more about every little change we make, checkout the *#updates* section on our Discord ( link at the bottom of our website ).

### Footprint 

Due to popular demand, we brought the old footprint layer back.

Now we have two versions:

- The newer one introduced in Alpha, called **Footprint (Profile)** 
- The old one **Footprint (Cluster)**.



We've also **flipped buys and sells** for both footprints, in order to be more consistent with other platforms.
The hollow candle behind footprints (profile) no longer have any gaps above and below.

Footprint (profile) delta is now **aligned to the left**, this way you can easily compare sizes visually.

**Font size has been increased** on both layers for better readability on smaller screens.
