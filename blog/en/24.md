We've been quiet for a while but that's mainly because we've been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work.

There's no such thing as a free lunch, every time we add something new it adds additional load on the servers.

As we improve the stability and optimize our code, we are able to provide more pairs at no additional cost to our users!

## Bybit integration news

We got an update from Bybit. We can expect a full orderbook support in Q1 2021. This would be the last piece of the puzzle we need before launching Bybit on our platform.
