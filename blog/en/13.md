We've been reworking the whole drawings system to allow more advanced customization.
If we did things right, you shouldn't notice anything being different at all.

## New stuff

- **Pen tool** is now silky smooth, draws like a butter _even after you drink 20 cups of coffee in a row and your hands are trembling like there's no tomorrow_.
- New **Measure tool** is introduced, hold `Shift` and click anywhere to draw it. <b style="background:var(--secondary);color:#FFF;border-radius:5px;padding: 0.2rem;font-size: 0.8rem;white-space: nowrap;">(As seen on TV!)</b>
- New & less confusing **Risk and Reward tool**
- Cancel/remove your unfinished drawing by using `Right Click`

## What's next?

We'll be launching our new **Alpha** server soon that will contain many improvements such as:
ultra-fast orderbook updates, high definition VPVR/Footprints, additional trading pairs and more.

Once it's up and running, any subscriber who's willing test it can just message us and we'll set up an account for you.
