## Additional servers

In order to provide the greatest coverage with reduced latency to all of our users, we deployed additional servers.

![](../../media/thumbs/server-map.svg)

- [us.tradinglite.com](https://us.tradinglite.com) - United States (East Coast)
- [sg.tradinglite.com](https://sg.tradinglite.com) - Singapore
- [jp.tradinglite.com](https://jp.tradinglite.com) - Japan
- [kr.tradinglite.com](https://kr.tradinglite.com) - South Korea
- [tradinglite.com](https://tradinglite.com) - Europe

This is part of our ongoing efforts to improve overall experience when using TradingLite.
In the future, the server selection will be completely automatic, but for now please use the subdomains.

_Let us know if you experience any issues with the new servers!_

## Instrument Information Dropdown

![](../../media/screenshots/instrument-info.jpg)

This dropdown will show you some basic information such as the block size on the heatmap ( for SD and HD ) and the units used.

We had to manually set the units and contract sizes for every single pair of each exchange.

_If you see any mistakes, please let us know so we can correct them as soon as possible._
