## Website changes

This is a long awaited update, at least for us, that we've wanted to do for quite some time but we were too busy working on the app itself.

Previous website was incompatible with older browsers, took a while to load and wasn't really search engine friendly (e.g. in case you wanted to find our content from Google). We've reworked it to bring improved browser support, fixed various user experience issues and made it easier for us to maintain in the future.


## TradingLite Manual

One of the most interesting work-in-progress pages is the **TradingLite Manual**, no, not for LitScript, but for the actual app itself.

We're currently looking for a contributor to help us create a nice guide on how to use TradingLite and its features, reach us out on [Discord](/discord) if you think you're that person. We will be offering a whole yearly plan if you think you can help us.


## Progress report 

We usually share our internal progress on our #lucky-channel on Discord (only visible if you have the lucky status üçÄ), but sometimes things are a bit too exciting to not share them with the world.

Here in the following screenshot you can see our work-in-progress new API with the latest platform we've been developing.

## Additional servers

We've also been conducting tests with additional servers closer to Asia. We'll write a dedicated post on this in the future.
