# Alpha

You've probably noticed that the current live version hasn't been getting any updates lately, that's on purpose.
 
We've been working hard for the past 3 months on the next iteration of TradingLite (codenamed **Alpha**), also known as phase 8.

All the newest features and experimental things are being implemented and finalized on Alpha. 

As of right now, __Alpha is our biggest update yet__.

Internally, so many things have changed that incrementally porting the changes over to the live version is near impossible.

Which is also why we've been quietly working on a migration plan so that the transition can happen seamlessly for our users.

## How can I join Early-Alpha test?

Alpha is nearing it's completion but if you're a subscriber, you can already give it a try!
*Just drop us a message on Discord and we'll get you an invite.*

## When will Alpha be completed?

We're aiming to open up Alpha to the public near the end of this month, which also happens to be when **TradingLite will be officially 1 year old !**

That's right, TradingLite, which started off as a hobby project and an internal tool, has now grown into a full fledged app that's used by thousands of users world-wide. A lot of love and sweat has been poured into TradingLite to make it what it is today.

We can't wait to share it with you!
