## Tips and Tricks!

We've improved our Help section to be more helpful towards new and existing users. You can find links to Discord, our community-driven Knowledge Base, and Tips and Tricks which contain video examples of some our features.

## Activate Scripts 

You can now enable and disable scripts without opening them!

Even though the current indicators UI isn't that great yet, this little feature will make things easier.

## Server-side LitScript v1 compilation

Previously LitScript v1 used to compile in 3 steps, `download > compile > result`.
In this update, we **reduced it to only 1 step** ! Meaning faster loading for Version 1 scripts.

Note that this <u>does not</u> mean that LitScripts are calculated on the server-side, you will know when that feature is available when we finally enable `Full Protection` option for LitScript sources.

## Stability improvements

If you previously had some weird issues with chart panes disappearing, it's possible that we fixed them with this update.
