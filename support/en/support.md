### Experiencing connection issues to TradingLite? 

Please try the following in **this** order:
1. Check that you are not behind a VPN/proxy. 
   The additional latency can result in degradation of your connection to TL.
1. If you are not behind a vpn/proxy, please try on an alternative browser (TL recommends chrome/brave).
1. If you are using chrome and are still experiencing issues, try using TL via an incognito window. 
1. If this still doesn&#39;t resolve your issue, it may be due to an issue with an extension. 
   On chrome, create a new profile. This new profile will natively have no extensions. Try to connect to TL again. 
   If your connection issues are resolved when using this new profile, your orginal profile's extensions are creating a conflict with TL.
   Try to disable each extension one by one to see which extension is causing your connection issues. (Please let a moderator or developer know which extension was causing the issue so we can inform other users.)

### Slow in Asia/America/Australia

For users in Asia/Australia, your issue may be due to your location in relation to TradingLite's European servers. 

TradingLite is currently working on providing servers globally which should provide you with a low latency connection. 

These servers should be available around **Germany** and **Finland**

If you have tried all the above and the internet gods are still working against you, reach out to a moderator on the [Discord](/discord) server, within the **#help channel**.

## Support for CME/NYMEX/FOREX & Other Traditional Markets

TradingLite will look to support traditional markets in future, however this is also dependent upon approval from such exchanges. 
There are stringent requirements/agreements/compliance required by both TradingLite and 3rd parties to make this possible. 
Due to this, integration of traditional markets may take a little while to implement.

## Display/Rendering Issues

**Please see below for your relevant browser.** 
 
> âš  If you have followed the respective steps for your browser and are still having issues, it may be due to an installed browser extension. Please disable each extension one by one to see if this resolves your display/rendering issues

**Safari**

  * **Note:** WebGL 2 is not implemented natively on Safari. 
    This has resulted in some Safari users experiencing issues when using TradingLite. ( for more information on this, see [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18055499) )

    * However there is a workaround that **some** users have stated resolved rendering issues on Safari:

      Go to Develop > Experimental > Reset to Defaults
      _(To enable the &#39;Develop&#39; menu, go to Preferences > Advanced > check: &#39;Show the Develop menu in menu bar&#39;)_

**Please Note:** Not all features may be available for Safari users (slight issue with heatmap lens), but this should work for most.
Alternatively you should consider using an alternative browser.

---

**Chrome**

Go to `chrome://gpu` in your browser and check the last 2 lines of the &#39;Graphics Feature Status&#39;. You should see:

  * WebGL: Hardware accelerated
  * WebGL2: Hardware accelerated
    
If either are showing **Disabled**, follow the instructions listed [**here**](https://www.interplaylearning.com/help/how-to-enable-webgl-in-chrome)
  
---

**If all fails**

If you still experience issues, you should try updating your graphics card drivers.

Note that WebGL 2 came out in 2017, so if your hardware is older than that then there's some chance that your hardware is unable to support it.
In such cases, you can always use TradingLite with hardware acceleration disabled but you may experience slower performance.
